Unicorns don't exist

Violet
Purple
Pink
Orange
Blue
Green
Indigo
Yellow
Crimson

These are the colours of the rainbow.

And the unicorn.
Pony
Banana
Im on fire
Chicken on hot
The Pony running on the ground.
And the beautiful pony.
And the unicorn eats grass.
The sun is yellow. 
I like turtles.






Roses are red 
Violets are blue
my computer is fast
but yours is slow
